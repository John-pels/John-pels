# 💻  John O. Emmanuel

Heya, 

I'm a Senior Software & AI Engineer with over 5+ years of experience designing and delivering enterprise-grade web and mobile applications across banking, fintech, education, and AI-powered digital platforms. Strong expertise in React, React Native, and TypeScript, combined with hands-on experience integrating AI and LLM-powered features into modern web applications using multimodal and generative AI APIs. Proven ability to build scalable, secure, and high-performance frontend systems in regulated environments. Experienced in cross-functional collaboration, frontend architecture, and mentoring engineers in distributed and on-site teams.

The internet is my fun place and my oyster. You’ll always find me contributing my knowledge, skills, and experience to developing projects that improve our lives.

My favorite pastime is teaching, as I dedicate time to mentoring and imparting knowledge to the next generation of promising tech talent on the continent.

I love learning new skills and teaming with fellow developers to build amazing stuff.
